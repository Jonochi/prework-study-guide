# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project depects a study guide where throughout the course I can add key notes to each section.
This will be a useful tool in organization and showcasing learning.
The guide will help compile thoughts and give e a place to refer back to when I need to refresh on topics.
During this study guide project, I learned a lot about git and GitHub. The biggest challenge I faced and overcame was remembering to pull main before each push to ensure proper merging.
